This is a template you can use for your final project. Fill in each section with information on your own project.

## Short Description

My project is a shiny app which allows the user to view different data from the National Material Capacities dataset. It allows the user to select a country and a variable to graph.

## Dependencies

List what software your code depends on, as well as version numbers, like so:.

1. R, version 3.1, to run locally
2. An internet broswer, to run on the internet

## Files

List all other files contained in the repo, along with a brief description of each one, like so:
